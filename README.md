Road Safety Report 
Executive Summary:
The year 2022 has shown a positive trend in road safety, with a notable reduction in 
both accidents and casualties compared to 2021. According to the data, accidents 
decreased by 11.7%, while casualties saw a significant drop of 11.9%. Particularly 
noteworthy is the 33.29% decrease in fatal casualties from the previous year, 
indicating an improvement in overall road safety measures.

Accident Trends:

The majority of accidents, approximately 73.2%, occurred during daylight hours. This 
suggests a potential need for increased safety measures and awareness campaigns 
aimed at reducing daytime accidents. Moreover, the analysis indicates that car 
accidents were the most prevalent, highlighting the importance of targeted safety 
initiatives for car drivers.

Casualty Analysis:

While there was an overall decline in casualties, rural areas experienced a more 
significant reduction compared to urban areas. This finding suggests that urban 
areas may require additional safety measures to further reduce casualties. Notably, 
roads with single carriageways witnessed the highest number of casualties, despite 
experiencing a decline in both accidents and casualties from the previous year. Dual 
carriageways followed closely, indicating a need for targeted safety efforts on these 
road types.

Severity of Casualties:

The majority of casualties resulted in the "Slight" category, indicating that most 
accidents did not lead to severe injuries. This highlights the effectiveness of safety 
measures in mitigating the severity of accidents. However, continued efforts are 
needed to further reduce the number of casualties in all categories.

Hotspots and Recommendations:

Roads leading towards London, Manchester, and Birmingham were identified as 
hotspots for accidents. This information can be utilized to implement targeted 
safety measures on these routes, such as increased police presence, speed 
enforcement, and public awareness campaigns.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the year 2022 has shown positive trends in road safety, with a 
notable reduction in accidents and casualties. However, there is still room for 
improvement, particularly in urban areas and on single carriageway roads. By 
implementing targeted safety measures and awareness campaigns, further 
improvements can be achieved in reducing accidents and casualties on the roads.
